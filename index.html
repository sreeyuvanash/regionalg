            <h2> what are regional games ?</h2>

            <p>Regional Games are multi-sport events held within a specific region 
                of the world. After the Olympics, many of the Regional Games 
                are the next most important sporting events in the regions.</p>
            <h2>What’s on regional sports networks?</h2>
            <p>As the name suggests, regional sports networks (RSNs) specialize 
                in broadcasting local sports. Each channel’s live game programming 
                depends on the sports teams located within the designated broadcast area.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Typically, RSNs show anything from high school athletics to major 
                league sports. You may even see less common sporting events like
                 surfing, poker, and fishing competitions. In fact, some RSNs
                  should really be labeled as RFNs (regional fish networks) for all the fishing content they air.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Outside of live events, RSNs also show classic game replays,
                 documentaries, and region-specific studio shows. It’s like having an 
                ESPN channel dedicated to your neck of the woods.</p>
